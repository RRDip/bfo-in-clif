The axioms, definitions etc of BFO as it then existed have been represented in CLIF (Ressler et al., 2012), as well as in first-order predicate logic in standard notation.  This project is to correct and improve this representation, implement native CLIF theorem provers (or parsers to translate CLIF to another format, e.g. Prover 9, Snark), and based on insights into the logic, to suggest further changes to BFO and to remedy possible gaps, unclarity, or contradictions. This work will track carefully the OWL 2 version of BFO 2.0 by Ruttenberg, Mungall, and others.
